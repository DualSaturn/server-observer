# server-observer
A discord bot I made for fun that pulls messages from a channel and then generates text based on what it has observed.
To generate the output, just type
```
<bot username>, what do you see
```
in discord chat.
This was made using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper for discord.
